# Introduction
Be a master of tracking where you and your collaborators are with tasks that you've got
an interest in, and use TaskMaster. This platform will allow task masters to maintain a
profile that shows tasks being worked on at a glance, where task masters can connect
with others on the platform, and communicate the state of each of their tasks through
the platform. It provides an easy way to create and assign tasks to task masters you
collaborate with, and search for any tasks within your network of task master
collaborators. You can even see an estimate of how busy each of your connected task
masters is.
