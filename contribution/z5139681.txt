Week 1
Group formed. All group members have chosen and agreed to doing Task Master for the project. Following our weekly 
meeting, it was decided that Yue Qi and I will be working on the frontend of the project. We have chosen Reactjs
as our programming language of choice.

Week 2
Initialised React frontend on Git and created a simple navbar with routes for the home, login and register page.

Week 3
Added on to storyboards created by Yue Qi. I separated Yue Qi's storyboard into chunks and added more detail to each one.
Also written descriptions to those storyboards. Added a couple of user stories and acceptance criteria on Jira.

Week 4
Implemented the frontend for the taskboard, a task creation page, a profile page and an update profile page covering user stories 
cwc-51, cwc-68, cwc-39, and cwc-40.

Week 5
Worked on linking the front and backend ports with Charles and Justin and presented with Charles in progressive demo A.
Also reworked the update profile page from a page with multiple buttons to a form, and implemented the update task 
and view profile screen.

Week 6
Implemented the frontend for task search, labels for tasks and the functionality to assign users to tasks. Also simplified
the structure of a task object as there were too many fields before.

Week 7
Hooked up the front and backend to the parts implemented in week 6. Reworked the taskboard and task display, 
allowing tasks to be filtered by state of completion and users to view created and assigned tasks separately. 
Added a list of assigned tasks to each user's profile.
