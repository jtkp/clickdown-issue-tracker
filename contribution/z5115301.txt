Week 1:

Synthesised list of core feature requirements from brief. 
Did competitior research into ClickUp and Mondays to identify common features to a taskmaster application that were not included in said brief.
Wrote initial draft of both user stories and extensions. 
Pitched to team members.

Week 2:

Initially was proposing a React / Django / MongoDB stack.
Did initial feasability testing and found that this may be difficult given both level of familiarity in the team and time constraints.
Began exploring hooking Flask and React together as an alternative.
Looked into chatbots and webhooks for easy event triggering and to check viability. - Recalled IFTTT service.
Added some of the user stories to Jira from Google Doc.

Week 3:

Wrote Design Rationale
Pitched condensed list of core "guaranteed" extensions to team.
Wrote material clarifying how 'groups' would function in final application and the rationale behind this.
Composed both software architecture diagrams and provided justification for our chosen technology stack.

Week 4:
Tested and connected MongoDB for possible database as postgres and sql alternatives had difficulties. Got writeable cloud database set up, however likely proceeding with Justin's serverless sqlite db, so this has been shelved.

Week 5:
Refactored server.py so that db functionality was encapsulated in db.py
Began dialogueflow preliminary tests and setting up webhooks via IFTTT.
